# How to use?
Open up [UCLA's Schedule of Classes page](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/public/soc) on Google Chrome, choose an academic quarter, choose a subject area, and let the class tracker do the rest.

# Output files
Each desired class attribute is put into a text file into the output folder.
```
class_codes.txt
class_names.txt
instructor_names.txt
units.txt
ge_categories.txt
finals.txt
writing_req.txt
```

# Future improvements
- [ ] Merge all output files into an excel worksheet
- [ ] Allow user to only have to choose an academic quarter, and have the scraping start at the subject level
- [ ] Scrape BruinWalk to enrich data
